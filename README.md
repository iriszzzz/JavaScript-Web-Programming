# JavaScript Web Programming
GhostWars is my final project of the course called JavaScript Web Programming, aimming to design lively web page with JavaScript. In the beginning of the lesson, we learned HTML tag representation and its syntax. After that, we made use of CSS to style HTML documents. Finally, we can use JavaScript programs to generate highly interactive interface web pages through Events and DOM.
